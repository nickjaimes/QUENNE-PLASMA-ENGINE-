12. CONCLUSION

The QUEENNE Plasma Engine implementation plan provides a realistic, phased approach to developing a revolutionary propulsion system. By combining rigorous engineering with cutting‑edge AI, the plan addresses technical challenges through early demonstration, incremental qualification, and comprehensive testing. The 10‑year timeline and $1.5B budget reflect the complexity and ambition of the project, but the resulting capability—a governed, adaptive, and highly efficient plasma engine—will enable missions previously considered impossible. With disciplined execution and international collaboration, the QUEENNE Plasma Engine will become the cornerstone of humanity's next era of space exploration.
