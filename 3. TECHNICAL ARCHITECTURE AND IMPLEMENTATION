Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed technical architecture and implementation plan for the QUEENNE Plasma Engine (QPE) —a next‑generation propulsion system that integrates a governed cognitive intelligence stack directly into the plasma generation and control loop. The QPE leverages hybrid photonic‑electronic computing, neuromorphic fabrics, quantum annealing, and a multi‑layered AI governance framework (Triad AI) to overcome the fundamental limitations of conventional plasma thrusters. The architecture is designed for scalability from 100 kW to 10 MW power levels, enabling missions ranging from satellite station‑keeping to interplanetary cargo transport.
